// This is a placeholder. You'll need to add an ambient drone MP3 file to your project.
// Since we can't directly create binary files through text, please add an ambient drone sound file
// named "ambient-drone.mp3" to your public directory.
// 
// You can find free ambient drone sounds on sites like:
// - https://freesound.org/
// - https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/
// - https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/
//
// Recommended characteristics:
// - Soft, subtle melodic drone
// - No sudden changes in volume or tone
// - 1-3 minutes in length (it will loop)
// - MP3 format, good quality but reasonable file size (under 2MB ideal)
